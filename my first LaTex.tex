\title{My first born}
\begin{document}
This is my first \LaTex document made  from scratch. I feel proud of it. I am writing more to test forming paragraphs, la la la la doo dah dee doo dah, this should be enough to make several lines of text. $2x^2+3$
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n i
\]

\begin{align*}
1+1+1 &= 2+1\\
&=3
\end{align*}
this should be a new paragraph. if it isn't than I am misunderstanding how this works.
